# Python code demonstrating a TypeError and its solution
This repository contains a Python function `calculate_average` which calculates the average of a list of numbers.
However, it has a bug: It throws a `TypeError` if the input list contains non-numeric elements.  The `bug.py` file shows the buggy code, and the `bugSolution.py` shows the fixed code. 
The bug is demonstrated in the example usage section.
The solution involves adding input validation to ensure that all elements in the list are numbers before performing the calculation.
